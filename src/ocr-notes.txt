You can get Adobe Acrobat DC Pro from UofA site license
You want 300-400 dpi for best results at OCR.
Problems with headers in newspaper columns,
does not recover bold font and different size fonts very well.
You lose color. You may lose capitalization.
Semantics get lost, text, highlights, colors are gone.

preflight DC Pro Acrobat
PDF/A - required format for court filings. Includes all the necessary fonts.
PDF/E - required format for engineering.

Adobe SDK -- need to purchase
Foxit SDK (Google Chrome) -- need to purchase
iText (version 7 is the latest) -- free for educational purposes (Java and C#)
PDFBox -- not as good
Want to call Java from MatLab
LSTM OCR -- works with 90% accuracy

inital-medial-final characters in Arabic
post-processing dictates the accuracy in the end
detect characters by area, small areas are diacritics
Using MatLab and Python --> C and C++ when done prototyping

--- 3 phases ---
segmentation - the right unit of English for OCR (ligatures or characters)
OCR phase
post-processing
----------------

kraken and tesseract have multiple models for arabic.
kraken native correctness is about 60-70-80%.
kraken works line by line
kraken is python with some C LSTM library dependencies
tesseract works either by character or by ligature
tesseract is implemented in C++/Python
programs combine the results of scans in multiple directions
Pashto has about 1000 ligatures in 4 different directions for 4000 models
Both networks use bi-directional LSTM in order to help limit the vanishing gradient problem
Use tesseract trained data for MatLab experimentation
